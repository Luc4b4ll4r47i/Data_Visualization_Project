# Marvel vs DC 
This repository contains the exam project of the "Data Visualization" course at the University of Milano-Bicocca.

Marvel and DC have always been in competition. There are key superheroes on both sides. Which raises the following question: which of the two companies is the better?
The project analyses the film divisions of both companies in order to answer the previous question.
More precisely, the revenues obtained from the films of the two different universes are studied, comparing budgets and receipts, in the opening weekend and totals, recorded in the USA and in the world. An analysis of the opinions of critics and the public is also carried out through the rating attributed to each film produced.
Data visualizations were created to allow the reader to identify the best company from the point of view of the earnings obtained by each film and per year, taking into consideration production budgets and reviews.
Finally, a heuristic evaluation was carried out to highlight any problems with the views, a user test that allowed to evaluate effectiveness and efficiency and a questionnaire to evaluate their satisfaction.
